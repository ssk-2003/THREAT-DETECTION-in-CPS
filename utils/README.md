# 🚨 INTELLIGENT THREAT DETECTION IN CPS-IOT NETWORKS USING A HYBRID DBN-CNN MODEL WITH SAEHO OPTIMIZATION

## 🔍 Overview

With the rapid integration of the **Internet of Things (IoT)** into smart cities and cyber-physical systems (CPS), ensuring the security of these networks is critical. Traditional security mechanisms often fall short due to the unique vulnerabilities of IoT infrastructures. This project introduces a **Deep Learning-powered hybrid framework** designed to **automatically detect cyber threats** in IoT environments.

## 🧠 Key Features

* **Hybrid Deep Learning Classifier**:

  * Combines the strengths of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for spatial feature extraction and **Deep Belief Networks (DBN)** for deep pattern recognition.
* **SAEHO Optimization**:

  * Introduces a novel optimization technique: **Seagull Adapted Elephant Herding Optimization (SAEHO)**.
  * SAEHO fine-tunes model parameters to significantly improve classification performance.
* **Anomaly-Based Detection**:

  * Identifies malicious vs. benign traffic in real-time network data streams.
* **Robust Evaluation**:

  * Validated on two benchmark datasets with high metrics in **accuracy**, **precision**, **sensitivity**, and **specificity**.
